export const defaultText=`Picnic: privacy first collaborative text editor.

This plain text document is editable, go ahead, try it.

It's been generated just for you, and the only way to read/write is to access the exact url you are on.

Share the link to a friend, and they'll be able to edit the text, like a really minimal Google Docs.

You could use it to keep a shared shopping list with your roommates, or to organize a picnic with friends.

Your changes are encrypted on your device, then we forward the encrypted version to the other people editing. You can check the code (it's short and sweet) on GitHub : https://github.com/renanlecaro/picnic
